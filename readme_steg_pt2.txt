/**********************************************************************
 *  Have you enter all help, collaboration, and outside resources
 *  in your help log?  If not, do so now.  (And in future, make sure
 *  you make your help log entries as you go, not at the end!)
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."

/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.
